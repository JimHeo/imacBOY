""" Function for detailed validation of a validation sample data set. The segmentation
    of these samples will be predicted with an already fitted model and evaluated.
Args:
    model (Neural Network model):           Instance of an already fitted Neural Network model class instance.
    validation_samples (list of indices):   A list of sample indicies which will be used for validation.
    evaluation_path (string):               Path to the evaluation data directory. This directory will be created and
                                            used for storing all kinds of evaluation results during the validation processes.
                                            if the evaluations will be saved on disk in the evaluation directory.
